# Music Player

This project was made to remember the basics of CSS Grid. It's a simple music player layout using HTML and CSS.

The project idea was taken from [Bora Codar da Rocketseat](https://www.rocketseat.com.br/boracodar).

You can see the [project running here](https://music-player-wheat-sigma.vercel.app/).
